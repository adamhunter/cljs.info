# "code too large"

Thought I would add this little lesson I learned from this project.

When I was initially starting off with the cheatsheet I used straight HTML to
get the layout / design right before starting any abstraction. My workflow was
just copy / paste Hiccups in one large render function.

At some point I made a new section and didn't see the result in the browser
after saving the file, then checked my console and saw this:

<img src="code-too-large.png" />

Guess there's limit on how long a function can be in Clojure :)

Fixed it with commit [83ba3913](https://github.com/oakmac/cljs.info/commit/83ba39132e93a98d37f4729d7f1d91e25a2d5c94)
