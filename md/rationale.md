## Purpose of this Document

The purpose of this document is to explain the rationale behind ClojureScript.
It is specifically designed for programmers who already know JavaScript (or a
similar variety thereof) and have the question "This seems interesting, but very
different from what I already know. Why should I learn this?"

## "JavaScript the Language" vs "JavaScript the Platform"

## "JavaScript the Platform" is a clear winner

## "JavaScript the Language" is not going to cut it

## What's in a Language?

## ClojureScript is not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction

## The Blub Paradox

## The Importance of Defaults
