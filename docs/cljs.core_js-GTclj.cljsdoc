===== Name
cljs.core/js->clj

===== Signature
[x]
[x & opts]

===== Description

Recursively transforms JavaScript arrays into ClojureScript vectors, and
JavaScript objects into ClojureScript maps.

With option `{:keywordize-keys true}` will convert object fields from strings to
keywords.

Note that `js->clj` is not optimized for speed and the [transit.cljs] library is
recommended for parsing large amounts of JSON data.
